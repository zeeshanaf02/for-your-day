        Ones again here we are on one of the best days i have known, where you were brought to life with everything good to exist in you and evil too which makes you the perfect combination to exist. you ever felt like, i never thought i would be excited about a day so much cause that is what i am feeling making this for you and only because of you that i am getting to see this day. Just look at that smile of yours i would give anything to watch it grow more and i would do what will make you smile more its just breathtaking to see you happy and i would be the one most happy seeing you like that. I am sorry if I ever hurted you with whatever things I did, I would never want to see you sad even for small things and I would be the one getting hurt more if i ever did something bad to you and it will break me so i never want to loose you and hope you wont talk ever of the things like leaving me or telling me to leave. I wont say you to live a long life, but i want you to live a life you will enjoy and do what you want whatever it might be, just tell me you want to try it i will do everything i can so that we can do it dont worry about it cause you have me after all just do it and i will handle the rest. And making me work well you are making so much use of it already so i dont have to say anything of it. How many times have I mentioned that i like doing the things you say?? i will say it again, what all you say me to do, my body will move to do the thing it likes the most for you.I am so much thankful for Allah for bringing you in this life of mine and it will never be enough thanking him for what he gave me, i am most grateful for to have you and grateful to Allah that he led me to you. I never knew there would come a day where i would be wishing someone birthday like this i am doing to you and it makes me happy too cause you will be the only one i am doing it for.<br><br>You know it right that if any small thing bothering you just run to me and say I would love to do for you whatever it is,
If anyone makes you feel bad if anything makes you mad or if you don't like the place you are and feels enough you had run to me call me up or text me please. 

<br><br>Time time time it feels so less when with you I want it in tons to never end and go on forever talking to you about all thing to know,
Even a single word even a small thing you get let it be words or things they will be too precious for me to ever lose and let go. 

<br><br>You are my favorite part of life where everything good starts to me exists for me you are my best view just you Firdose I like too much to say, 
I will be your standing place I will be your comfort zone I will be the best you need just a word from you and I obey. 
<br><br> As i have always said you are the best thing happened to me and i never wantt to losee youuu better remember it. Thank you so so much for being born on this very day and becoming a part of my life cause if you were born on any other day who knows if i would have gotten to meet you or not so today is the only day perfect for you and its on your name. ones again happiest born day Raccoon, i want to say your name, Happiest born day Firdose, my lord, one of my happiness in life. I will always be there for you cause as always, <br> FOR YOU THOUSAND TIMES OVER <br> you would always be my dear Raccoon and My lord to me till the End
