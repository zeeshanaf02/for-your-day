            <h1 id="welcome-text">Hi, what should I call you? Fid? Okay let's go with it. I heard I'm the best character you read and you worship me? Is that true? Well that's what he told me. You love my story so much where I'm from a people saving group and fall in love with an romance book author like how did it even connect I don't know. I just stood there and my sight on her and my eyes got a habit of looking at her from then on, stalking her, scaring her roses and kisses and more you know which I need not feed with words. I heard it's your birthday today. I wish I could have taken shown you the place we keep the people we save with adeline as a present for you or you want to experience something like adeline did?? I hope not. I wish to come out of book and wish you for the day that is only yours but little mouse will kill me if she finds out. Firsode, wishing you for the best day to exist and also on behalf of adeline, Happy birthday. As long as I'm out here you'll always be safe from any mark out there and make no mistake I would personally wish to kill every person who might make your day bad today.

            <h1 id="welcome-text"> Have heard alot about you from him and about how much you love bikers. Wish I could take you to long ride on this Storm of mine. I heard it's your birthday today so I thought how wish I could have taken to you to my floor so that you would have gotten the view of world beneath you, the sun going down in your eyes, the rain dropping at your hands with tapping sound making you completely lost of everything happening. I also heard you are just like morana, specs, great looking and God your intelligence, may be you were supposed to be written in a book but were brought to life as it can get more value to it. Wish I could spend more time here cause you ain't anyone like others I have seen and you love us so much it's enough reason for me to tear the book and come to you if I could. But I have to find luna as you know don't die till then. Dante and Amara were happy to know about you and wanted to see your for themselves but they are in middle of something don't mind so is your Morana and she'll strangle me if she finds out I'm here wishing to you. Happy birthday, anyone ruins it I can break the door and smack their face.
