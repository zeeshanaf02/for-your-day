            <h1 id="welcome-text">Hi there it's lana. Heard you loved reading me and my revenge. Not many people tries to know about us, I wish to torture them even now without killing every single one of them. Are you not satisfied with anything in it? I should have done something more? After everything that me, my brother and father went through and now it still aches my heart remember that hell. But now I have killed every single one of them peeling the skin and doing every possible inhuman thing to them that they earned. You know everything else about that and it's your day today it seems, what you want? Wanna see me kill someone? Wish I could kill that boogeyman infront of your eyes and show you how strong you are. You are safe as long I'm out here, anyone dared touch you he will breath last that day cause someone probably gonna pay a visit to him at night. Wish I had brought you to our anniversary but can't pull you inside books so happy birthday from both of us and it's written on you today everything that exists.

            <h1 id="welcome-text">Yo my lord how many times have I mentioned Lately that you are getting perfect and more perfect everyday. A dumb, weird and definitely an idiot to know along with sharp, quick witted and umm quite an intelligence stored there in that small body. Never knew you would become so much to me and one I would give highest priority as much I give you. You would always be the star for me that I look upon when I'm lost and only thing I need when the most. Having you feels like a blessing only I got and I hate everyone who got to know you from so long even your friends I get so much jealous of them and also great full for them that you are what you are because of what you have with them and whatever you are now is what perceived as perfect and it will always be same. My lord I like so much and would probably best thing to happen to me. I would ever be happy meeting you and knowing you and it's always want to know more. Is there anything you want? Wish I could get you more and make you smile with happiness and even tears of happiness but uff Allah who knows how many years I need to see that. Happiest born day to my only lord everywhere and only one I serve. If I'm above all then you are above me. That smile of your and everytime you speak my ears earns more for that voice of yours, the best to exists nails of yours and best suited hairs I know and most importantly your words and soul it's a mean one but I like it that way and it only brings me to one thought just how many years was needed to make a perfection like you and how many years did Allah had to spear for you. Just know you are always best at most of things and you can do what all you want if you ain't lazy but that part of you is so good too. Wish to see you smile with soft eyes and warm wind and you in it and the world will have achieved alot.
